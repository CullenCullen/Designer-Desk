# Designer-Desk
This program calculates the cost of constructing custom desks for customers using decision structures. 
After the customer enters the appropriate prompted values(length, width, wood type, # of drawers),
the program will calculate the cost of the desk. The program then allows the user to order a second desk if desired.
